Physics-Engine
==============

Built in Objective-C for xcode

Physics Engine - I have included rotating rectangles and circles. Each objects has position, velocity, acceleration, drag, elasticity, mass, size, rotations, etc.
The engine updates positions and velocities and then checks for collisions.
There is an interactive HUD that allows changing colors, framerate, positions, and velocity.
Clicking and dragging on the main window changes the velocity vector.
